Vaccination impact in the US
===================

--> [online application](https://holtzyan.shinyapps.io/the-nb-como-project/)


Overview
--------
A very tiny shiny application allowing to explore the impact of vaccination in the US between 1928 and 2003.

I built this application as a demo of my shiny skill for a Job Interview. The time limit was 1h, what explain all the imperfections you will find in the app.




How to use the application
--------
The best way to use this application is via its [online version](https://holtzyan.shinyapps.io/the-nb-como-project/).

If you really want to use this application locally you can:

**1.** Clone the whole repository

**2.** Open R and make sure all the required libraries are installed (see top of the global.R file). If you miss a library, remember you can install it with:
```
Ã¬nstall.packages("nameOfTheLib")
```

**3.**
Then, set the working directory and run the App:
```
setwd("my/path/to/the/github/folder/you/downloaded")
library(shiny)
runApp()
```
